## Business Activities 

The co-founders, Armstrong and Ehrsam, identified the need for a trusted and user-friendly platform for buying and selling Bitcoin. At that time, Bitcoin was still a relatively new concept and was primarily being used by tech enthusiasts and early adopters. The founders believed that by providing an easy-to-use platform, they could help bring Bitcoin to the masses. In July 2012 the first service offered was the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin to users in the United States using bank transfers. Coinbase expanded its services in the following year to include the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin in several other countries, as well as the ability to store and send Bitcoin. Now Coinbase offers a variety of currencies such as not limited too ethereum, litecoin, and solana.  With many options, the company gives its users the instant buying feature with just using a credit or debit card. Coinbase has also focused on regulatory compliance, working closely with government agencies and legal experts to ensure that it is compliant with the law. Coinbase has been praised for its focus on regulatory compliance, with some experts saying that it has played a key role in legitimizing the cryptocurrency industry. This makes Coinbase one of the markets safest platforms; they use robust security as two factor authentication and biometric authentication to ensure the safety of the user assets .

## Landscape

Coinbase is a leading online platform for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrencies. It operates in the realm of digital finance, facilitating transactions of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Coinbase provides users with a secure and reliable platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, as well as managing their digital wallets. The company has gained widespread popularity due to the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies in recent years and has become a go-to destination for many crypto investors and enthusiasts. With its commitment to user safety and security, Coinbase has emerged as a trusted name in the emerging landscape of digital finance. Over the last ten years, Coinbase has made several significant innovations and contributed to the growth of the crypto industry with Cryptocurrency wallets, Merchant services, Crypto-focused investment products, and their user-friendly mobile app. Coinbase has played a significant role in the growth of the cryptocurrency industry over the last decade and continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with digital assets. Along with Coinbase pushing the front in the crypto world is Binance like Coinbase is another platform in which  cryptocurrency is being exchanged, but they differ in a few ways. Coinbase is a more user-friendly and beginner-friendly platform that allows you to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies using your bank account or credit/debit card. It has a simpler interface and fewer trading pairs compared to Binance. Binance, on the other hand, is a more advanced and sophisticated platform that has a wider range of cryptocurrencies available to trade. It offers advanced trading features like margin trading, futures trading, and more trading pairs than Coinbase. Binance also has its own cryptocurrency (BNB) that can be used to reduce trading fees on the platform. Coinbase is a great place to start. But if you're a more experienced trader who wants access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies and advanced trading features, Binance is also a good choice but requires a little more leg work to be set up and use the feature that everyone may not have access to use.

## Results

Coinbase has had a major impact on the world of cryptocurrency, as it gives people an easy and secure way to buy, sell and store digital assets. They have created a platform that is accessible to both experienced investors and newbies, and have introduced millions of people to the concept of blockchain technology. Coinbase has also helped to establish cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of currency, and has brought a whole new level of transparency and efficiency to the financial industry. To measure that amount of success of coinbase, uses several core metrics to measure its performance and success examples include, Trading volume by measuring the total amount of cryptocurrency bought and sold on the platform. Number of users who have created accounts on their platform to use their services. Revenue and profit track how much money they're making through things like trading fees and other revenue streams. Customer satisfaction surveys Coinbase would want to know how happy their users are with their platform and services, so they may track metrics such as response times to customer service requests or the number of positive reviews and ratings.

## Recommendation 

If I were able to advise Coinbase and make changes to improve the company would first simplify the interface a bit more because for new users the outline can be overwhelming that would refrain new users. Second, expanding the amount of different currencies by doing that would make people's portfolios more diverse. This would be completed by adding more popular cryptocurrencies.  Third, I would enhance the security measures to reassure users and the safety of their assets. To enhance the security measure would make a program that would make hacking people's accounts impossible. Coinbase is an all round good company/platform for buying, trading, and selling crypto assets. With acceptional secuirty meassures so the average user can be secure while using the platform.
